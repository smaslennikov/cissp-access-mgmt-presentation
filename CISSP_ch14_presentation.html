# CISSP - Chapter 14 - Controlling and Monitoring Access

---

Page 2
-->

# Authorization Mechanisms

1. Implicit Deny
2. Constrained Interface
3. Context-Dependent Control
4. Least Privilege

---

# Defense-in-Depth

Multiple layers of access controls for security

1. Physical Access Controls
2. Logical/Technical Controls
3. Administrative Access Controls

???
Ex: Physical Servers in our IDF

# Access Control Techniques

A. Discretionary Access Controls
  - Who controls and defines access?

  1. Owner
  2. Creator
  3. Data Custodian
  
  Ex: Creating a new Excel spreadsheet 
???
Next slide discusses Non-discretionary Access Controls

B. Non-discretionary Access Controls

1. Role-based Access Control

2. Rule-based Access Control
  - Ex: Firewalls

3. Mandatory Access Controls

???
1. RBAC - Discuss roles in our environment and how we use that to assign permissions

2. Rule-BAC - 
Ex: Firewalls

3. MAC
Ex: Users and objects have labels. Military classification of data that allows access based on clearance level

# Risk Elements

A. Identify assets

B. Identify threats
  1. Threat modeling

    a. Focused on Assets

    b. Focused on Attackers

    c. Focused on Software

C. Identify vulnerabilities

???
A. identify actual value of assets with goal of prioritizing them.
Determines cost-effectiveness of different security controls

B. Threats modeling. Asset focus uses valuation results to identify threats to those assets.
Focused on attackers considers attackers' goals to identify threats. ex: political standpoints
Focused on software considers threats against it's software which presents more threats, especially the more traffic it gets.

C. Vulnerability analysis identifies strengths and weaknesses of diff access control methods and potential of a threat

# Access Control Attacks

A. Password Attacks
  1. Dictionary Attacks
  2. Brute-Force Attacks
  3. Rainbow Table Attacks
  4. Sniffer Attacks

B. Spoofing Attacks

C. Social Engineering Attacks
  1. Phishing
  2. Spear Phishing
  3. Whaling

D. Smartcard Attacks
  1. Side-channel attack

E. Denial-of-Service Attacks (DoS)

???
A. Mention top 10 passwords used from published account information stolen from a Sony attack 
  1. Dictionary - crack password by using every possible password or character combinations from a database of common passwords
  2. Brute-force - crack password by trying all possible combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols. Hybrid attacks
  3. Rainbow table - uses pre-computed hashes to compare every hash in a password database file (would have to steal that).
  4. Sniffer - software that captures packets sent over network. Encrypt data over the network

B. Email spoofing. Phone number spoofing

C. Social engineering can happen in person, over the phone, or over the internet
  1. trick into giving up sensitive info
  2. targets specific users, like employees
  3. specifically targets senior or high-level execs

D. observes operation of device and can learn info contained on card, like encryption key

E. Sends so much traffic to servers it prevents legitimate traffic or processing of requests
